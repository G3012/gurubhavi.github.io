            <p>Hie.... <br>I am Gurubasava Bhavi (but everyone call me guru) from Gulbarga,Karnataka and I belong to ECE dual degree dept.I am just a beginner in HTML and CSS and this is my first website.Actually there is nothing special about me but let me say a few things about me.I would love to play cricket and I am a fast pace bowler who is aiming to play inter IIT's.I am a member of Click KGP also which itself says how much photography excites me and you can also see some of my clicks in next section.Apart from these I am super interested in driving,nightouts,longdrives.... and mainly I am a chai lover.So finally I am expecting a new family and spending some of the most beautiful time of my life with them from this coming college life.  </p>
